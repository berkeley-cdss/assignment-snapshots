# notebooks

This directory contains code for the Exploratory Data Analysis part of the Assignment Snapshots project.

## Requirements

You have already run the [backups CLI](../backups/README.md) commands to create the backup files and SQLite databases
in the [`../../data/private/`](../../data/private/) directory.

## Installation

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. `cd` into this directory (`src/notebooks`)
3. Run `uv sync` to install dependencies and create the virtual environment (`.venv/`)

## Usage

1. Open this directory in its own VS Code window (make it the root directory of the window) so that VS Code recognizes the virtual environment in `.venv`.
2. Run any of the notebooks, selecting the appropriate Python kernel within `.venv`.
