## Continuous Integration

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to run [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/). See `.github/workflows`.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) package to automatically run
the black Python formatter upon running `git commit`. Hooks can be added to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
